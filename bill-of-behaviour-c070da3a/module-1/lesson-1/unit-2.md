title: Profiling with Kubescape

name: honeycluster-up
---

Now, we are still the vendor and have the `webapp` deployed on our cluster. 
We are producing `benign` traffic that triggers all known behaviour of our `webapp`

Viktor made a video of this feature, so if you dont know kubescape, consider watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xilNX_mh6vE 

::remark-box

kind: warning

__IRL__: the vendor needs to ensure that all application and network behaviour during a normal productive usecase
are being triggered. Usually, this would be a combo between integration, load and behaviour-driven tests. Maybe UX test
or traffic replay.

::


We have installed `kubescape` (see the Makefile for details), it will help us use `eBPF/Inspector Gadget` in a hands-off manner via its nodeagent-component. So  we'll use a config that only installs the runtime-behaviour module produce an output that an end-user can directly consume, without having to deal with inspector gadget or ebpf or low-level stuff.

```sh
kubectl get pods -n honey -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=kubescape
```
<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">

__Optional__:

While waiting for all pods to be ready, you could spend the time playing with the UI `k9s`

<!-- and if you're the graphical type, you can move over into the other tab :tab-locator-inline{text='Explorer' name='Explorer'} and watch what's happening on the cluster.

I DON'T recommend the Explorer on the 3-node kubernetes cluster, its too slow -> works well on `k0s` though... -->

If all kubescape pods are healthy, we can move on and inspect our `ApplicationProfile`, that will serve as base for our BoB. (if any of the pods are unhealthy, the `ApplicationProfile` is likely incomplete and you should not use it)

```bash
kubectl get pods -n honey -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=kubescape
```
You want the `STATUS` of all pods to be `Running`
```
laborant@dev-machine:~/honeycluster$ kubectl get pods -n honey -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=kubescape
NAME                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kubescape-6685556665-5p6sh   1/1     Running   0          21m
kubevuln-5645447f88-6dc65    1/1     Running   0          21m
node-agent-5n6fr             1/1     Running   0          4m50s
node-agent-5wxzs             1/1     Running   0          4m56s
node-agent-w4c2g             1/1     Running   0          5m41s
operator-5dddf6f84-8nlpl     1/1     Running   0          21m
storage-54597f8454-nlgfh     1/1     Running   0          21m
```
Next, we ll check the configuration in order to understand  long we are expected to wait until a profile is considered ready.
The settings are in a `ConfigMap` and `CustomResourceDefinition` named RuntimeRuleAlertBinding

```sh
kubectl describe cm -n honey ks-cloud-config
kubectl describe RuntimeRuleAlertBinding all-rules-all-pods
```


So, you first wanna remember the exclusions that are set in the `rules`:
<!-- ::remark-box

kind: warning

TODO: remove the ignoreMounts/Prefixes by default, havnt found how to do that elegantly
```sh
kubectl edit RuntimeRuleAlertBinding all-rules-all-pods
```
:: -->

```yaml
  namespaceSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - key: kubernetes.io/metadata.name
        operator: NotIn
        values:
          - kubescape
          - kube-system
          - cert-manager

          - gmp-public
          - honey
          - storm
          - lightening
          - kube-flannel
  rules:
    - ruleName: Unexpected process launched
  #check that the following BLOCK is not in the file
    - parameters:
        ignoreMounts: true
        ignorePrefixes:
          - /proc
          - /run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
          - /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount
          - /tmp
  # BLOCK THAT SHOULDNT BE THERE - END
```


Couple of other important settings to be aware of that govern the anomaly detection and the
learning duration. i.e. how long we have to generate a `benign behaviour` profile. 
<!-- I chose to set these durations to be very small, as this is a demo. 
::remark-box
---
kind: warning
---
TODO: figure out if the annotation in the webapp `kubescape.io/max-sniffing-time: "2m"` takes precendence. it seems to break on k0s
and if it overrides the learningPeriod or the maxlearningPeriod or both. (the `"scanTimeout": "5m"` is related to grype and has nothing to do with the runtime stuff)
:: -->

```
nodeAgent:
  name: node-agent
...

  config:
    maxLearningPeriod: 5m # duration string
    learningPeriod: 2m # duration string
    updatePeriod: 1m # duration string
    nodeProfileInterval: 1m # duration string
```

in order to display this, you `can` open `k9s` by typing that in your terminal.
Then, using `vim` syntax (the one and only), inside the k9s dialogue
```bash
k9s
:helm
```
select `kubescape-operator` using the arrow-keys and press `v` for seeing the values of the `helm chart`.

```

In the beginning, we should not have any ApplicationProfiles.

```sh
kubectl get applicationprofile -A
```

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name:  profilecomplete
---
#active
Profile is still not complete

#completed
Application profile is now complete
::

after some time: likely, you ll see something like:
```json
NAMESPACE   NAME         CREATED AT
default     replicaset-webapp-85974bd68f   2025-04-16T13:58:34Z
```
Now, you may switch of the looping in the other tab and look at generated profile

```sh
export rs=$(kubectl get replicaset -n default -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
kubectl describe applicationprofile replicaset-$rs
```

We want to wait until the status is completed




If the above indicator is `green`, this means that the following event has been reached by kubescape:

```sh
kubectl logs -n honey -l app=node-agent -c node-agent | grep ended
```


```json
{"level":"info","ts":"2025-04-16T12:06:57Z","msg":"stop monitor on container - monitoring time ended","container ID":"8ac882eefce545c63fdad8d090f7d6074389301c0474b9aed810f207fa62e924","k8s workload":"default/webapp/ping-app"}
```


We want to wait until the status is completed


Also, in the crd annotation, you will find the status completed now. 

```yaml
kubectl describe applicationprofile replicaset-webapp-xxx
...
...
Annotations:   kubescape.io/status: completed
```

Now, we must save this above file onto disk:

```sh
kubectl get applicationprofile replicaset-$rs -o yaml > app-profile-webapp.yaml
```


Great job!
