# WARNING - UNPROTECTED ASSETS

Do not put any sensitive information in this folder.

While the markdown content is subject to full authorization checks,
the static assets are not. This limitation is due to the extensive
use of CND (e.g., Cloudflare) to deliver static assets with the best
possible performance.

With some careful URL-construction, files placed in the __static__
folder can be fetched via the API by potentially unauthorized users.
This includes anonymous users, bots, and crawlers. The caching duration
of these assets is also very long (up to 1 year).

If you wish to store private files alongside the content, make sure
to place them outside of the __static__ folder.
